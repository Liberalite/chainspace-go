## Chainspace Prototype

This is a quick and dirty prototype (read: no unit tests, little overall concern for code quality). Its purpose is to sketch out an overall system architecture, run some initial performance tests, and learn a bit about how we should structure the codebase overall before making any heavyweight commitments.

### Development Setup

Prerequisites:

* the `dep` package manager, see: https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html

Setup:

* `dep ensure`
